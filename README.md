# Track Saw Rail Dog Clips

![alt text](preview.jpg "Preview")


## Summary

Inspired by UJK's dog rail clips, here's a fully printable clip that works for the Triton tracks.

This is likely compatible with the Makita tracks as they too have the anti-tip lip.  Festool owners can just buy the UJK part.

The design assumes your cutting surface is above the 10mm base of the Parf Dogs as the spring clips only can reliably go around the 20mm diameter section of the posts.
